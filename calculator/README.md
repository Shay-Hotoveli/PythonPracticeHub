<h1>Calculator Program</h1>

This is a Python-based calculator that supports a variety of operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division. Additionally, it allows users to log calculations, view stored calculations, and clear logs through a straightforward menu-driven interface.

Improvment to come:
1.Refactoring calculate function to improve readability 
  replacing match/case to dictionary to map operations to functions
  making it easier to add operations in the future
2.Improve view_calculations function adding empty log check
  avoiding printing when there are no content written in the file
3.Allow users to type "q" to exit to the main menu during number or operation input.
4.Improve the visual appeal and organization of the main menu.
 A clear and visually appealing menu enhances user experience and guides navigation.
5.Allow users to perform additional calculations on the previous result, similar to "Ans" on physical calculators.
6.Update the result display format to include the entire calculation (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8 instead of just 8).
7.Organize log entries neatly and add options for scrolling or controlling the output (e.g., showing the last 5 entries).
